# Project Governance

## Consensus Seeking Process

The Node.js project follows a [Consensus Seeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making) decision making model.

## Collaborators

The [nodejs/node](https://github.com/nodejs/node) core GitHub repository is maintained by the Collaborators who are added by the Technical Steering Committee ([TSC](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC)) on an ongoing basis.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made Collaborators and given commit-access to the project. These individuals are identified by the TSC and their nomination is discussed with the existing Collaborators.

For the current list of Collaborators, see the project's [README.md](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/README.md#current-project-team-members).

A guide for Collaborators is maintained at [collaborator-guide.md](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/contributing/collaborator-guide.md).

## Top Level Committees

The project is governed jointly by the [Technical Steering Committee (TSC)](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/master/TSC-Charter.md) which is responsible for high-level guidance of the project, and the [Community Committee (CommComm)](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/blob/master/Community-Committee-Charter.md) which is responsible for guiding and extending the Node.js community.
